Regions
-------
Regions are the tables that are split up 
and spread across the region servers.

RegionServers
-------------
Software processes (often called daemons) 
you activate to store and retrieve data in HBase (Hadoop Database).

The region servers have regions that -

Communicate with the client.
Handle read and write requests for all the regions under it.
Decide the size of the region by following the region size thresholds.


HMaster
------------
Is responsible for region assignment 
as well as DDL (create, delete tables) operations.


Quorum
------
The Quorum is a list of hosts on which ZooKeeper servers are running.


HBase Tables – Logical collection of rows stored in individual partitions known as Regions.
HBase Row – Instance of data in a table.
RowKey -Every entry in an HBase table is identified and indexed by a RowKey.
Columns - For every RowKey an unlimited number of attributes can be stored.
Column Family – Data in rows is grouped together as column families and all columns are stored together in a low level storage file known as HFile.


1. Goto https://archive.apache.org/dist/hbase/2.2.5/

2. Download https://downloads.apache.org/hbase/stable/hbase-2.2.5-bin.tar.gz
   
3. Put the downloaded package into /usr/local/software
   Put the extracted package into /usr/local/hadoop-ecosystem
   cut the hbase-2.2.5 inside of hbase-2.2.5.bin, paste into haoop-ecosystem directory, then delete the hbase-2.2.5-bin
   
4. Open hbase-env.sh in /usr/local/hadoop-ecosystem/hbase-2.2.5/conf

1)Enable JAVA_HOME: 

In your terminal, check your Java_home path: 
hadoop@ubuntudev:~$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64

Then put the JAVA_HOME path, HBASE_REGIONSERVERS path and HBASE_MANAGES_ZK in the file, code to add as below: (  export JAVA_HOME={JAVA_HOME_PATH}  )

//this path comes from echo $JAVA_HOME
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64    
export HBASE_REGIONSERVERS=/usr/local/hadoop-ecosystem/hbase-2.2.5/conf/regionservers
export HBASE_MANAGES_ZK=true


5. Open bashrc file and add the path

Add HBase Path
#Hbase path
export HBASE_HOME=/usr/local/hadoop-ecosystem/hbase-2.2.5
export PATH=$PATH:$HBASE_HOME/bin

//source is a shell built-in command which is used to read and execute the content of a file
//use source ~/.bashrc to execute the code that we just put into the file
hadoop@ubuntudev:~$ source ~/.bashrc 
hadoop@ubuntudev:~$ echo $HBASE_HOME
/usr/local/hadoop-ecosystem/hbase-2.2.5


6. Open hbase-site.xml in /usr/local/hadoop-ecosystem/hbase-2.2.5/conf

hadoop@ubuntudev:~$ cd /usr/local/hadoop-ecosystem/hbase-2.2.5/conf
hadoop@ubuntudev:/usr/local/hadoop-ecosystem/hbase-2.2.5/conf$ sudo gedit hbase-site.xml

//Put the document below to the <configuration>:

<property>
<name>hbase.rootdir</name>
<value>hdfs://localhost:9000/hbase</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
<value>true</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
<value>localhost</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>dfs.replication</name>
<value>1</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
<value>2181</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>
<value>/usr/local/hadoop-ecosystem/hbase/zookeeper</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>hbase.tmp.dir</name>
<value>./tmp</value>
</property>

<property>
<name>hbase.unsafe.stream.capability.enforce</name>
<value>false</value>
</property>

7. Start hadoop deamons if hadoop is not running ($jps)

8. Start HBase
hadoop@ubuntudev:~$ start-hbase.sh

9. Check to make sure the HBase is up and running

//HQuorumPeer, HMaster, HRegionServer will be added to the deamons
  
hadoop@ubuntudev:~$ jps
3170 NodeManager
16660 HRegionServer **
16566 HMaster **
2903 SecondaryNameNode
2535 NameNode
16520 HQuorumPeer **
17017 Jps
3034 ResourceManager
2703 DataNode
